                    In phase 1, clients would need to log into the mobile application to access multi-factor
                    authentication and see if they qualify for a higher daily transaction limit.

                    In phase 2, clients would be able to see if they qualify for a higher limit through Online Banking.

                    that it is a potential increase and we must be cautious as to not mislead the client. We also don't
                    want any messaging to seem promotional, as it could appear deceptive or be missed by the user due to
                    "banner blindness". Overall, we need to ensure that our system remains <strong>upfront, reliable,
                        and trustworthy.</strong></p>

        <p>Our team considered three pages for the added functionalities to IMT – the IMT Landing page, Transfer Details
            page, and final Confirmation page. Through a heuristic evaluation, we weighed the advantages and
            disadvantages of each approach.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9">
                <p>The information is upfront, and offers transparent communication with the client. However, users tend
                    to click on the call-to-action without thoroughly reading through the other content on the page,
                    which can make it possible to miss.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9">
                <p>Our team felt that this option seemed the most relevant as it's where the clients are conducting
                    transfers, and the placement is more likely to help clients avoid multiple transfer fees. Although,
                    we also determined that it might lead to a potential overload of information and could be difficult
                    to integrate it with existing components.</p>

            <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-9">
                <p>Adding the messaging at the end will not interrupt the transfer flow, which could improve the
                    transfer experience. However, the disadvantages seemed to greatly outweigh the potential benefits,
                    as this option is not as upfront and lacks transparency. Moreover, clients often don't take the time
                    to review the information on confirmation pages, and would likely miss it. Thus, we decided to feature the messaging on the Landing page, and make it available as a tooltip in the Transfer Details page.</p>

                <p>To finalize the project, we would have met with the accessibility team to ensure that the design would remain accessible through the development of the product. Following the development of the feature, we would test the flow to ensure there are no bugs and that the functionality works as planned. In order to measure impact, the Business Analyst would measure how many people start the flow through Online Banking, and how many complete the transfer to mobile. For extra small breakpoints, we would also create a link to access the mobile app. Further into the future, we would start on phase 2 of the project.</p>
