                    <p>The establishment of Regent Park Community Centre has opened up new opportunities to brighten the
                        lives of those residing in the neighbourhood, but these interactions have become severely
                        limited
                        during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

                    <h3>Solution</h3>
                    <p>From their own devices, the system allows users to remotely connect with others in their
                        community,
                        providing them with resources related to the community centre and the various services offered.
                        Through virtual programming, the system encourages real time participation in events,
                        activities,
                        learning, and social interaction. </p>

                    <p>Through an iterative process, the product was developed with preliminary research and user
                        testing. With an <strong>AEIOU Observation Framework</strong>, we began by analyzing Regent Park
                        Community
                        Centre’s current page. It displays a variety of essential information to the physical
                        location—such as
                        operating hours, address, COVID-19 notices, and accessibility features. We also noted that the
                        webpage rarely incorporates imagery and does not allow for
                        opportunities to connect with others, offering little as a
                        standalone experience. In order to adapt to the social distancing expectations at the time, it
                        was crucial
                        for
                        us to <strong>remodel these activities to accommodate an online space.</strong></p>

                        Throughout this project, our team was constantly challenged with finding alternative solutions
                        to transfer the community centre’s activities onto an online space. We had to ensure that each
                        component carried the spirit of the physical location, while maintaining the usual levels of engagement and
                        accessibility.</p>

                        consistency across all sections to offer a seamless experience for the user. We achieved this by
                        setting styles, carrying over components, and keeping constant communication to ensure that the
                        team worked in sync towards the same goals.</p>
