                    create a cohesive brand, arrange the page layouts, and prototype the experience.

                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>We were tasked with developing an app experience for exploring video games as an avenue to connect
                    with friends and family. Provided with the freedom to decide on a target audience, we chose to
                    design an engaging and intuitive experience to introduce seniors to the world of video games</p>

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>Our application presents a personalized selection of games based on the user’s preferences and
                    abilities, captured through a series of activities and multiple-choice questions. All game
                    recommendations are multiplayer to encourage social interaction with friends and family.
                    We believe gaming should be for everyone, and DiscoverGaming helps reach a largely underserved
                    demographic in the industry.
